# Temperature-Based-Fan
A smart fan system that automatically adjusts its speed based on room temperature range, ensuring comfort for disabled individuals without requiring manual control.

This project uses an Arduino and a temperature sensor to read the room temperature. Based on the readings, the fan speed is adjusted using a motor driver.

## Benefits 
- **Energy Efficient-** Reduces unnecessary power consumption, lowers bill.
- **Increases Device Lifespan-** Prevents overheating-related damage.
- **Smart Integration-** Supports IoT and AI automation.

## Components Used 
-	**Arduino UNO**
-	**Temperature Sensor** (DHT11)
-	**LCD Display** (16 Ã— 2)
-	**I2C Module**
-	**Breadboard**
-	**Jumper Wires**
-	**DC Fan, Motor Driver**

## How It Works
1. Temperature sensor detects the temperature and sends data to Arduino.
2. Arduino processes the data and decides fan speed.
3. Motor driver adjusts fan speed accordingly.
4. LCD displays real-time temperature & fan speed.

## Applications
- **Industrial Use:** Prevents overheating in factories.
- **Server Cooling:** Prevents overheating in data centres.
- **Greenhouses:** Regulates air circulation for plant growth.
- **Smart Homes:** Comfort automation for elderly or disabled individuals.

## Future Scope
-	**Bluetooth-Based App** (Offline Control) where users can customize the temperature range.
- **Voice-Activated**
